# Module-2-challenge
# This will sort loan applicants for approval per bank criteria and should save the new information to a csv, although I don't think I did that part correctly. I do not understand the the csv aspect, it's confusing and nonsensical, there are no images or code blocks becasue I don't know how to do that, there is no commit log becasue I get a rejection from the CLI everytime I try to push changes to Git from the CLI,even after cloning the repository, so I resorted to drag and drop.
